# 2DPlatformerChallenge
Test project of 2D Platformer.

The main task was to create a simple 2D game in the platformer genre.

- During the game, you need to control the moving object (background and objects move from right to left).
- The player must dodge obstacles.
- When a collision with an obstacle the game ends (should be the ability to restart the game).
- The player can shoot at obstacles and destroy them (should be several types of obstacles with different amounts of armor).
- Obstacles move towards the player at different speeds.
- Control: Arrows - move around the screen (up, down, acceleration,braking); Spacebar - shot.
- Visual execution - it does not matter, you can use any test graphics.

Date of completion: December 3, 2016
